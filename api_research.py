LeetCode GraphQL API Research and Implementation Notes

Based on specification and additional research:

Endpoint: https://leetcode.com/graphql
Method: POST
Authentication: Uses LeetCode session cookie

RESEARCH FINDINGS:
================

1. Main Query for Submissions:
   - Query name: "submissionList"
   - Parameters: offset, limit (for pagination)
   - Returns: submissions array with fields needed

2. Required Headers:
   - Content-Type: application/json
   - Cookie: sessionid=<user_session_cookie>
   - User-Agent: Professional user agent string
   - Referer: https://leetcode.com/

3. Response Fields Needed:
   - id: Unique submission ID
   - title: Problem title (human readable)
   - titleSlug: URL-friendly slug (used for filename)
   - statusDisplay: "Accepted", "Wrong Answer", etc.
   - lang: Programming language
   - difficulty: Problem difficulty level
   - code: The actual submitted code

4. Filtering Logic:
   - Only fetch submissions where statusDisplay == "Accepted"
   - Track already fetched submissions to avoid duplicates
   - Process in batches of 50 per API call

5. Language Extension Mapping:
   Python → .py
   JavaScript → .js
   Java → .java
   C++ → .cpp
   C → .c

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
====================
- Use requests library for HTTP calls
- Implement retry logic (3 attempts, 2-second delay)
- Handle session expiration gracefully
- Log all API interactions for debugging

Query Structure (GraphQL):
{
  submissionList(offset: 0, limit: 50) {
    submissions {
      id
      title
      titleSlug
      statusDisplay
      lang
      difficulty
      code
    }
  }
}

Error Handling:
- Network errors: Retry with backoff
- Session expired: Prompt user to update cookie
- Rate limiting: Respect API limits
- Invalid response: Log and continue
